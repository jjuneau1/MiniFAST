The following details Other 3D-printable devices that I designed for RNEL and Jill Juneau
--------------------------------------------------
General Notes:
--------------------------------------------------
.stl and .stp files are provided. Use .stl for 3D printing, and .stp for editting 3D models using CAD software of your choice. 
.form file provided for lens holder. Just send it to the pritner.

Model Descriptions:
--------------------------------------------------
Histology Slide Mount:
	• Used to place approximately 75mm by 25mm histology slides (3'' by 1'') on an optical table / platform.
	• As provided, mounting holes are 1'' apart, made to fit M6 or 1/4-28 screws.

Miniscope Clamp:
	• Used to clamp the miniscope when it needs to be firmly and statically held in place.
	• Made to be attached to an optical table or platform.
	• Is provided in to configurations, Regular and reversed, allowing to mount a miniscope normally or upside down.
	• As provided, mounting holes are 1'' apart, made to fit M3 or 4-48 screws.

Lens Holder:
	• Made to pick up 1.75 GRIN lenses using a vacuum sucker. 
	• A provided, will fit ~4.5mm vacuum tubes.

3D printing suggestions:
--------------------------------------------------
Histology Slide Mount:
	• Print using FDM machine.
	• 0.2mm layer height works fine.

Miniscope Clamp:
	• Print using SLA machine, Form 2.
	• Suggested layer height - 0.1mm.
	• Do not print flat on the bed, rotate by 10-15°.

Lens Holder:
	• Print using SLA machine, Form 2. 
	• A fully completed configuration provided in .form file in the "FORM2 files" folder.
	• Suggested layer height - 0.025mm.
	• Once exported into PreForm, rotate by: 
		Y axis: 180°
		X axis: 10°
	• 0.5-0.6mm support touchpoint diameter works best.
